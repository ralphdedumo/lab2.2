            Back in my childhood days, I really play a lot of games especially MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle
            Arena). The first game I used to play is Warcraft III, usually called &quot;Dota 1&quot;. I really like playing DotA 1
            because you can adapt both personal and team skills. Personal skills like; hand and eye coordination, on
            point strategy, team building, fast reflexes, and many more. Since DotA 1 started last 2003, it is updated
            in 2013 which is called DotA 2 and it is the major update in this game.
          </p>
          <p class="dark">
            This includes the graphics,
            arrangement of the different icons and stuffs, but the cool part is the same gameplay. I really like to play
            games that are PC based in the past and now it is mobile now, like Dragonest M, Laplace M, Ragnarok
            M, but I find it expensive game because I really like to spend money to advance in the game or to make
            my character to look unique due to limited costumes and equipment.
            I started playing Ragnarok M a week after it is released. I wanted to try this game because in the past, it is a PC based game, 
            but now it is in mobile so I tried it. After of months playing it, 
            I find it expensive cause just like I said I really like to buy limited items to look cool and fashionable, 
            and after many money and time spent, I just stop it.
            The second MOBA I played is Mobile Legends. A friend introduced it to me so I tried it. For me, it is the fast paced DotA and LoL and due to its fast-paced game, 
            it’s incredible to play MOBA in fast paced in your phone and like I really said that I want to look my character look good,
             so I even spend some of my money to this game.
