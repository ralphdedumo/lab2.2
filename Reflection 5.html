          <p>
              The only thing I enjoyed about the fest, is a stressed free day, but suddenly we can't really enjoy the fest due to some priorities.

          <p class="dark">
            At first, we didn't feel the vibes of SoCIT week, until the seminars started and we are required to attend as much as possible
		  within the week. We have some time to relax and not to think about the requirements, projects and assignments just for a
		  week. I enjoyed it a little bit because of this, but it different from the SoCIT week I experienced last year.
