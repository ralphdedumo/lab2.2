          <p style="text-indent: 40px">
            Just like in other schools, classes in Asia Pacific College start at 7:30 in the morning. 
            Since it is a college school, most of the students must travel early because they live far away from school.
            As a result, students will have their breakfast in the cafeteria.
          </p>
          <p style="text-indent: 40px" class="dark">
            Since the students are chasing their class, they need to eat quickly. 
            As a student of APC, we often experience the slow queueing system of the stores in the cafeteria, 
            specifically the Adryon store, resulting in we come to class late.
        
          
            We noticed that their strategy is to ask the order of the first 4 or 5 students in line and prepare their food,
            then they will ask for the payment of those students. 
            The payment system also consumes a lot of time in computing the order and returning the change, 
            causing the queue line to get so long. 
            It is very time-consuming, and we could rather use the waiting time in line with something productive. 
            We need to solve this problem since APC is strict with the number of lates and absences, 
            and studies show that we couldn't think properly if we're starving. 
            We also consider the payment system in printing.
            <p style="text-indent: 40px" class="dark">
            By the use of e-wallet, it also takes time in typing the ID number of the student and their password. 
            It is inconvenient for the students who need to rush a document to be passed on time.  

While brainstorming on how to solve this problem, we had a few ideas for the solution. We plan to solve the payment system for faster transactions. The options we considered is by the use of ATM or credit card and through our ID. In using ATM as a mode of payment, we consider that not all students have ATM or credit cards. Since we discovered that our ID has an NFC feature, we could utilize it for a faster payment system. It will be easy for us to implement the project since every student, professor and school staff have their IDs. This project will surely make a difference in school.
