            As Miss Jen said that we will going to publish our created website in Heroku,
             I got excited cause this can help me improve my Web Design technique with the help of some users, 
             who can criticize my design and give any remarks or suggestion to better present my project. 
          </p>

            When my classmates told me that we’re going to have a quiz, I expected it is in some online platform like Moodle, or in MS Teams. 
            <br>
            After I enter the URL, I think this is going to be a piece of cake for me, but it was a mistake. 
            It is an experience for me to create a great, simple and easy to navigate website.
            After the frustrations how to go to the next item, and after clicking the wrong buttons, 
            I finished the test within 6 minutes, even the user interface is a wreck.
