          <p>
            In the first of week of our USERDES was great. Miss Jen’s interaction in class is not boring and not that hyper, 
            or me it is in the average to keep the students learn and fun at the same time. 
            When she introduced that we are going to have a project related to html and web base designing, I got excited.

            Since I really like to know more on User interface due to its creativeness, 
            at first it hard to visualize cause I’m not that artistic person but with the help of my friends and internet,
            I found it more exciting to build my own website and to start earning.

            <br> 
            By the help of the daily lessons, I learned how to do my things step-by-step, 
            I can’t do it instantly, but I wish I can do it fast as I can and create a beautiful artwork from these steps.
