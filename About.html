          <p style="text-indent: 40px">
                 Hi! I'm Ralph Martin Dedumo, just call me Ralph. I was born on November 13, 1999. I live in Calamba, Laguna. I'm currently 18 years old. 
                We always travel early from Calamba to Magallanes every day to go to school. 
          </p>
          <p class="dark">
                I spent my summer playing mobile games, travelling around Manila and Laguna, and going to the gym for the better me. 
                After playing games, I usually practice my programming and web design skills due to the fact that I’m a part of my sister’s web business, so I obliged to practice 
                and enhance my computer skills to pay off their trust for me. 
                I'm that type of person that is easily to approach, but you become one of my closest friends, you'll find me more easily to approach but sillier than ever. 
                I'm expecting for this class is to know how to make designs of every platform to be used because I have this background in Web Developing, I want to do more creative, productive and active web.
