              <h3>1. First Week of USERDES</h3>
              <p>In the first of week of our USERDES was great. Miss Jen’s interaction in class is not boring and not that hyper,
                 for me it is in the average to keep the students learn and fun at the same time. </p>

              <h3>3.First Web Application using Github and Heroku</h3>
              <p>As Miss Jen said that we will going to publish our created website in Heroku, I got excited cause this can help me improve my Web Design technique with the help of some users, who can criticize my design and give any remarks or suggestion to better present my project.</p>
